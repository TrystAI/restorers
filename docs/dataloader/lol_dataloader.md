# LOL Dataloader

The LOL dataset is composed of `500` low-light and normal-light image pairs and is divided into `485`
training pairs and `15` testing pairs. The low-light images contain noise produced during the photo
capture process. Most of the images are indoor scenes. All the images have a resolution of `400Ã—600`.
The dataset was introduced in the paper
[Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04560v1).
